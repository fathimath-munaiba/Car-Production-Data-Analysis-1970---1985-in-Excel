Car Production Data Analysis (1970 - 1985)
Overview

This project analyzes car production data from 1970 to 1985, covering attributes like Mileage (MPG), Displacement, Weight, Cylinders, and more. The project includes data cleaning, sub-totalling, pivot table creation, and visual analysis.

Features

âœ… Summation of car weights per model yearâœ… Pivot Table Analysis: Filters for Year, MPG, and Cylindersâœ… Pivot Chart: Visualizing trends based on filtered dataâœ… Handling missing data using appropriate techniques

Technologies Used

EXCEL
